TESTING FOR THE SERVER

to test the database, first press the 'show the buggy' buttons, it should load the
deafult values of a buggy.

then to test the app, press the 'Make your buggy' button and fill in the required data,
to test the valid check of data, enter data that would no be accepted by the specification.

(#2-EDIT phase of the app has stopped working when 'buggy=None', starts working again
when 'buggy=record' in line 30 of app.py, but the ability to make new buggies will cease)

the follow is used for my local system to activate the app in windows CMD
(cd C:\Users\Errolson\Desktop\CS1999-buggy-race-editor-master\CS1999-buggy-race-editor-master
.\venv\Scripts\activate
set FLASK_ENV=development
python app.py)
